# Saezuri

This is the front-end to go with Saezuri, an API I wrote that occasionally grabs the newest tweets under some bird-related hashtags from Twitter and saves them to its own database.

## How to Run

Requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Clone the project into a new directory, then run `npm install` and then `npm start`.

## Planned Improvements

* Render images consistently when they're supposed to be there
* Handle non-image media (videos, etc.) on tweets
* Handle retweets to eliminate redundancy
